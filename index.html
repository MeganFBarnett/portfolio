<h3>What I can do for you!</h3>
	<p>If anyone knows my abilities and motivations it would be me.I hope to gain your faith in my abilities and your desire to have me on your team. Before I begin I will break down my speech. Foremost I will tell you about my skills within the profession of Web Development and Design. Then I will elaborate about personal qualities that would make me beneficial to a team.
</p>
	<p>To begin, let me tell you about the skills I have gained over the past few years at UALR.  First let me tell you about my skills pertaining to Web Development. I have a firm understanding of HTML and CSS. I have been building with HTML and CSS for the past four and a half years guided by my professors. There is still plenty more for me to learn but I like to think I’m at least competent within both HTML and CSS. I also have some understanding of SCSS. Currently using Udemy I am self studying one JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, Jquery, and Node JS. I am always seeking ways to advance my knowledge within the Web Development field. 
</p>
	<p>Now let me tell you about my skills pertaining to Design. From my courses at UALR I have begun to master a large amount of Adobe Creative Cloud software. I have a good understanding of Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, After Effects, and DreamWeaver. Though DreamWeaver pertains more to development than design. I have also begun using Photoshop at my current job. I create flyers and banners for our website. I also have an understanding of other design softwares that I won’t list now.  Now that I’ve presented you with my list of skills let me tell you about my qualities that make me a great team member.</p>
	<p>All of my life I have strived to be punctual to a fault. Even if it means I will be waiting in the parking lot for 30 minute before work I will leave early, just in case something goes wrong. Once when I worked at Pizza Hut my car broke down so my grandma had to come get me and take me to work. I called work saying I might be late and still showed up 10 minutes before my shift. I will always ensure all work is completed with plenty of time to spare. You never know what could go wrong so it’s important to give yourself plenty of time.
</p>
	<p>I am also highly organized. I tend to plan out what work I’m going to do weeks in advance and schedule them on my calendar. That’s not to say I’m not open to adjustments. I will change my plans at the last minute if needed. By maintaining organization it helps bring perspective to assignments and lower stress on projects. With me on your team I’ll ensure everyone knows what needs to be done and by when.</p>
	<p>I hope this provides you with a firm understanding of my skills and qualities giving you the ability to decide if you want me on your team. I have given you a detailed list on my skills in both Web Development as well as Web Design. Illustrating that I have the knowledge to be successful.  I have also informed you of my organizational skills as well as my punctuality. With me on your team I will use all of my ability to make our projects successful and create a happy team.</p>
